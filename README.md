# React Todo List

React Todo List is an app in which you can add todos or task that one needs or intends to accomplish. You can add tasks by typing in the input with the placeholder "type a task". You can also delete tasks by hovering your mouse over an inputed task, when the trash icon appears and the background turns red, and you can delete this task. Also is possible to check and uncheck the task.  The tasks will be stored in the localstorage, so your settings will be the same when refreshing the page of the app.
